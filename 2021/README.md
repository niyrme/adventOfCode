# AoC: Year [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)
This year I will do the challenges in Python!

### Runner script
I've added a runner script to run the the days conveniently from one location<br>
The script requires the day to run as an input. The day must be in range of 1 to 25.<br>

Example: `python runner.py 3`<br>
-> would run day 3

If the day given is invalid or there's no solution for that day, an error message will be printed.<br>
Adding the `-T` or `--skip-tests` flag skips the tests for that day (tests are run by default)
